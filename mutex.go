/** From http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/recipes.html#sc_recipes_Locks
 * Clients wishing to obtain a lock do the following:
 * 1. Call create() with a pathname of "_locknode_/lock-" and the sequence and ephemeral flags set.
 * 2. Call getChildren() on the lock node without setting the watch flag (this is important to avoid the herd
 *    effect).
 * 3. If the pathname created in step 1 has the lowest sequence number suffix, the client has the lock and the
 *    client exits the protocol.
 * 4. The client calls exists() with the watch flag set on the path in the lock directory with the next lowest
 *    sequence number.
 * 5. if exists() returns false, go to step 2. Otherwise, wait for a notification for the pathname from the
 *    previous step before going to step 2.
 *
 * The unlock protocol is very simple:
 *  clients wishing to release a lock simply delete the node they created in step 1
 *
 * Note that this is not goroutine-safe and will not work for directories with other children!

 * Obtaining a read lock:

 * 2. Call getChildren() on the lock node without setting the watch flag - this is important, as it avoids the
 *    herd effect.
 * 3. If there are no children with a pathname starting with "write-" and having a lower sequence number than
 *    the node created in step 1, the client has the lock and can exit the protocol.
 * 4. Otherwise, call exists(), with watch flag, set on the node in lock directory with pathname staring with
 *    "write-" having the next lowest sequence number.
 * 5. If exists() returns false, goto step 2. Otherwise, wait for a notification for the pathname from the
 *    previous step before going to step 2
